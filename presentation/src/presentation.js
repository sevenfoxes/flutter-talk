              Hi, today I'll be showing you why I think flutter is a better choice for developing iOS/Android apps natively than a javascript framework, or even the device's native language.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first heard about flutter at strangeloop and a couple things stood out to me, but I wasn't sold on it. The more I study it, the more exciting it looks and I think it could become the dominant force in multiplatform devleopment.

              Flutter is a dart framework for developing apps on iOS and Android. It is rapidly moving towards a release candidate and is already on its third beta. Google says it's now ready for production.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its goal is to give developers a way to build great apps, fast. How does it do that? Let's look at some of its marquee features...

          <Notes>
            <p>
              With zero configuration (outside installing the framework) you will be hot reloading on both iPhone and Android devices. The reloading is fast too, under 500ms typically.

            <p>
              Making apps that look good is pretty straightforward too. Flutter comes with a standard set of material widgets that you can change to suit your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also adapt to working on iOS or Android naturally. No need to write custom widgets for each platform.

                thanks to reasons we'll cover in a bit, the performance of a flutter app scales with device specs and if your device supports 120Hz refresh rate, flutter runs at 120FPS!

            <p>
            If you do any Googling about flutter or Dart, you're going to come across someone saying "Dart is dead". Dart is most certainly NOT dead. Google uses Dart and flutter extensively and Dart in particular, due to its use on adwords, represents a sizeable amount of internal development.
            </p>
            <p>
            Google is also developing a new operating system codename Fushia based around flutter. and this year they had 6 google.io sessions for flutter.
            </p><p>
            Not the sort of thing you'd expect from a dead language.
