            <p>
              Hi, today I'll be showing you why I think flutter is a better choice for developing iOS/Android apps than a javascript framework, or even in some cases, the device's native language.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first heard about flutter at strangeloop and a couple things stood out to me, especially its headline features that we'll cover in a second, but I wasn't sold on it, mainly because I have never done native development before. I have been wanting to branch out from being exclusively a javascript developer so, rather than doing the obvious and learning react native, I started learning flutter. I've been looking at and building the example apps for awhile now and I think it could become a dominant force in multiplatform devleopment.

              Flutter is a dart framework for developing apps on iOS and Android. It's currently beta but has seen a significant amount of progress in devleopment and Google says it's ready for production.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its goal is to give developers a way to build great reactive apps, quickly. How does it do that? Let's have a look at some of its biggest features...

            <p>
              With zero configuration (outside installing the framework, an editor, and a plugin) you will be able to hot reload on both iPhone and Android devices. Reloads are fast too, often under 500ms.
            </p>
            <p>
              React Native can do this as well, but there are cases where react native cannot be hot reloaded. Flutter seems to be able to hot reload from pretty much any state short of a package installation.

            <p>
              What good is super fast reloading if there's nothing to reload? Flutter comes with a standard set of material widgets that you can customzie to suit your needs. These work a lot like writing custom react Components, discrete trees of code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flutter's material components also adapt, KIND of... to working on iOS or Android automatically, but it maintains that material look across Android and iOS. The upside is, You get one codebase that targets both platforms.

              thanks to reasons we'll cover in a bit, the performance of a flutter app scales with device specs and if your device supports 120Hz refresh rate, flutter runs at 120FPS! It is as fast as any native app, runs on both iOS and Android from a single codebase, and has an AWESOME development environment. There's a few things that I'd like to cover before jumping into the coding demos that get brought up a LOT when talking about flutter

              If you do any Googling about flutter or Dart, you're going to come across someone saying "Dart is dead". Literally, one of the first first articles you may have come across is titled "<a href="https://medium.com/@richardeng/dart-is-dead-aedced9fd3d1">dart is dead</a>". However, Google uses Dart and flutter extensively, Dart in particular, Due to its use on adwords. Dart code actually represents a sizeable amount of internal development at Google.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to Adwords, Google is also developing a new operating system, codename Fushia based around flutter and Dart. They also had 6 google.io sessions for flutter this year.
            </p><p>
              Not the sort of thing you'd expect from a dead language.

              Earlier I put an asterisk next to material look and feel. I also mentioned that regardless of platform, the app doesn't visually appear different by default. Google chose, I feel, intentionally to make their widgets conform to their own material standards, for simplicity. As opposed to making them fit both and their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that google is encouraging people to build interfaces that are cohesive between platforms with their own design language, NOT Google's. Material is simply the starting point.

              One last complaint I'd like to look at is Flutter's widget tree. I took issue with this myself when I first saw it. It doesn't look particularly intuitive. especially In this example, it's not easy to tell what things do, it's not very dry. Why is it like this?

              Oh, that's interesting. When you look at it this way, it's sort of like HTML. But HTML isn't code. it's pretty static. Which is not what you want in your app, This is where flutter's "interface as code" let's us get around writing this big tree. Since it's just classes, you can factor them out into logical pieces or simply put them in different files. But technically, there's still a tree...

              This is an example of a reactive application architecture, such as you get from React Native. You're application is actually excecuted across a bridge that alows your javascript to interact with OEM widgets. This Javascript bridge is slow. Each side of the bridge is fast, but this bridge is a bottleneck, so you need to write your app to minimize trips over the bridge.

            <p>
              Lastly we have Flutter and you can see that things are a bit different. First, you'll notice that dart isn't in this picture. Your code is AOT compiled to native. This completely removes the need for any sort of bridge. More than that, It doesn't access OEM widgets or webviews for that matter, instead provides its own and renders straight to canvas.
            </p>
            <p>
              This illustration shows what makes it fast, there's no bridge, and why it has opted to provide its own design language. Because it needs to bring its own components with it to fully provide its speed advantage.
