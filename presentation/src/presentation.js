              Hi, today I'll be showing you why I think flutter is a better choice for developing iOS/Android apps than a javascript framework, or even the device's native language.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first heard about flutter at strangeloop and a couple things stood out to me, especially its headline features that we'll cover in a second, but I wasn't sold on it, mainly because I have never done native development before. I have been wanting to branch out from being primarily a javascript developer so, rather than doing the obvious and learning react native, I started learning flutter. I've been looking at and building the example apps for awhile now and I think it could become a dominant force in multiplatform devleopment.

              Flutter is a dart framework for developing apps on iOS and Android. It's currently beta but has seen a significant amount of progress in devleopment and Google says it's now ready for production.

              With zero configuration (outside installing the framework, an editor and a plugin) you will be hot reloading on both iPhone and Android devices. Reloads are fast too, often under 500ms.

            <p>
              What good is super fast reloading if there's nothing to reload? Flutter comes with a standard set of material widgets that you can customzie to suit your needs. These work a lot like writing a custom react Component.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flutter's material components also adapt to working on iOS or Android automatically. You have one codebase that targets both platforms.

              thanks to reasons we'll cover in a bit, the performance of a flutter app scales with device specs and if your device supports 120Hz refresh rate, flutter runs at 120FPS! It is as fast as any native app, runs on both iOS and Android from a single codebase, and has an AWESOME development environment. There's a few things that I'd like to cover before jumping into the app that get brought up a LOT when talking about flutter

              If you do any Googling about flutter or Dart, you're going to come across someone saying "Dart is dead".  Literally, google dart is dead and the first result is about how dart is dead. However, Dart is most certainly NOT dead. Google uses Dart and flutter extensively and Dart in particular. Due to its use on adwords, dart represents a sizeable amount of internal development codebase at Google.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to Adwords, Google is also developing a new operating system, codename Fushia based around flutter and Dart. They also had 6 google.io sessions for flutter this year.
            </p><p>
              Not the sort of thing you'd expect from a dead language.

            <p>
              Earlier I put an asterisk next to material look and feel. And that's because the app doesn't visually appear different from platform to platform by default. Google chose, intentionally to make their widgets conform to their own material standards as opposed to making them fit both Apple's design guideline, and their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that google is encouraging people to build interfaces that are cohesive between platforms. Whether that's just using google's material, something completely custom or something in-between.

              This is an example of a reactive application architecture, such as you get from React Native. You're application is actually excecuted across a bridge that alows your javascript to interact with OEM widgets. This Javascript bridge is slow. Each side of the bridge is fast, but this bridge is a bottleneck, so you need to write your app to minimize trips over the bridge.

              Lastly we have Flutter and you can see that things are a bit different. First, you'll notice that dart isn't in this picture. Your code is AOT compiled to native. This completely removes the need for any sort of bridge. More than that, It doesn't access OEM widgets or webviews for that matter, instead provides its own and renders straight to canvas.
